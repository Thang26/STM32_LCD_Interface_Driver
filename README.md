# STM32_LCD_Interface_Driver
This is code that I wrote to learn how to interface with an LCD via STM32F446RE.
I also used this opportunity to learn how to create my own HAL for this LCD driver.

This repo uses the driver folder from STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.27.1. This includes BSP, CMSIS, and STM32F4xx_HAL_Driver.
Additionally, it uses the STM32F446RETX_FLASH/RAM linkerscripts.
